# Test manifest for InferencePool status when no pods match the selector.
# This manifest defines an InferencePool with a selector that is not expected
# to match any running pods, and an HTTPRoute to make it accepted by a Gateway.
# The inferencepool_status_no_matching_pods_test.go test will use these
# resources to verify the InferencePool's status conditions.

# --- InferencePool Definition for No Matching Pods Test ---
# This InferencePool is configured with a selector that should not match any pods.
apiVersion: inference.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: InferencePool
metadata:
  # This name should align with variables used in the corresponding Go test file.
  name: pool-no-pods
  # This namespace should be one created by the base manifests.
  namespace: gateway-conformance-app-backend
spec:
  # --- Selector (Required) ---
  # Selects Pods; configured here to match no running Pods.
  selector:
    app: "non-existent-app" # This label is not expected on any pods

  # --- Target Port (Required) ---
  # The port the model server container would listen on if pods were found.
  targetPortNumber: 8080

  # --- Extension Reference ---
  # GKE-specific configuration reference.
  # May not be strictly necessary for this test's core logic (no pods),
  # but included for structural validity if the CRD requires it.
  extensionRef:
    # group: "" # Optional
    # kind: Service # Optional
    name: pool-no-pods-epp # Unique name for this test's extension reference

---
# --- HTTPRoute Definition for No Matching Pods Test ---
# This HTTPRoute links the InferencePool to the shared Gateway,
# allowing the InferencePool to receive an "Accepted" status condition,
# which is often a prerequisite for further status processing.
